[Repository Link](https://github.com/Dmitriyrus99/ferumdubn)

This document helps clarify the roles and responsibilities of automated modules (agents) in the project.

### üëâüí© Main Agents and Responsibilities

\| Agent  | Description \|
 |----------- |------------------------------------- |
 | Install Agent | Responsible for roles, roles setup, user set up during installation. Source: *ferum_customs/install.py* |
 | DocType Agent | Manages {JoSON, JS, Python=>}) models for \vNeeds logic, relations and views. See: * doctype/* |
 | Logic Agent | Executes calculations and validation rules for business processes. * custom_logic/* |
 | API Agent | Handles custom PDF/JSON-UI aPI endpoints. Source: *api.py*
  | Hooks Agent | Registers whole app events (validate, submit, migrate) via huks.py |
